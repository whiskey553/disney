<p>One of my favorite parts of a Disney vacation is the food! At<strong> <a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q4wo0815240016F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aulani, A Disney Resort &amp; Spa</a></strong>, guests can enjoy a variety of delicious foods and beverages at one of the many dining locations. Our partners at Aulani shared the Mickey Mouse-shaped Musubi recipe from <strong><a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/dining/quick-service/ulu-cafe/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q4wo0815240017F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ulu Cafe</a></strong> with us today so you can experience some of the magic of Aulani at home! </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>If you like savory foods with just a little bit of sweetness, this is the perfect dish for you! The homemade sauce adds the perfect amount of sweet to the recipe and the furikake seasoning adds just enough crunch to the musubi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Now that I’ve talked about this delicious treat, it’s time to share the recipe! The Mickey Mouse-shaped Musubi can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated for an easy meal or snack. If you are serving a crowd, the recipe is easily doubled.  </p>

<p>Warm wishes from <a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1214230009H">Aulani Resort</a>! While things may look a little different this time of year here in Hawai‘i (have you seen Santa’s surf skills?), our holiday spirit is no less magical.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Aulani Resort cast members kicked off December with a new show,&nbsp;&#8220;He Mo‘olelo Hemolele: A Story of Faith, Hope &amp; Aloha&#8221;&nbsp;inspired by Disney Parks’ beloved holiday tradition, Candlelight Processional, but with&nbsp;a cultural twist&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;hula,&nbsp;Hawaiian chants, storytelling&nbsp;and songs&nbsp;woven&nbsp;throughout.</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sa86268276387368268222.jpeg" alt="Cast members from various areas of Aulani Resort join in He Mo’olelo Hemolele: A Story of Faith, Hope &amp; Aloha" class="wp-image-332048" /></figure></div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Cast members from various areas of Aulani Resort join in &#8220;He Mo’olelo Hemolele: A Story of Faith, Hope &amp; Aloha&#8221;</em></p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>This limited-time experience brought together&nbsp;dozens&nbsp;of volunteers from across the resort who expressed their joy of the season in a way that’s never been done at Aulani Resort. “Being involved in&nbsp;&#8216;He Mo&#8217;olelo Hemolele&#8217;&nbsp;has filled me with a sense of pride in our mo‘olelo (stories), mele (music), leo (voices), and hula (dance) that is shared with our guests from around the world,”&nbsp;shared Entertainment Activities&nbsp;cast&nbsp;member Charles Timtim. “And now they can experience the holiday season from a distinctly Hawaiian view.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In case you didn’t have the chance to experience&nbsp;&#8220;He Mo&#8217;olelo Hemolele,&#8221; it’s still&nbsp;easy to tap into the holiday and aloha spirit when strolling through Aulani Resort. Beautiful Christmas trees and garlands deck the halls, bringing a particular warmth to the grounds.&nbsp;What better way to celebrate the season than with resort carolers, boughs of holly, a giant Mickey sugar cookie,&nbsp;and average temperatures around 80 degrees just steps from our pristine Ko Olina beach and lagoon? Along with our incredibly ‘olu‘olu (kind) cast members, it all adds up to a holiday to remember.</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Giant Mickey Sugar Cookies from Ulu Cafe are the perfect holiday treat</em></p>

To celebrate the season here in Hawai‘i, we welcomed 20 wish kids and their families for a spooktacular week-long bash full of thrills, chills and ghoulish good times!</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:16px"><strong><u>How Cast Members Brought the Disney <em>Aulani Wish Week</em> to Life</u></strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Disney has worked with Make-A-Wish since 1980 to grant <a href="https://disneyconnect.com/dpep/disney-and-make-a-wish-foundation-celebrate-150000-disney-wishes-granted/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1026230023A">over 150,000 wishes</a>, and we are the largest wish granter in the world for Make-A-Wish. Historically, one out of every two wishes granted in the U.S. through Make-A-Wish has been a Disney wish.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Of these wishes, approximately 150 per year are to visit us at Aulani Resort for a unique Hawai‘i vacation with a touch of Disney magic, and we wanted to make these wish kids part of our ‘ohana. In that spirit, <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/topics/disney-cast-life/">cast members</a> across Aulani Resort worked together to dream up a week filled with authentically-Aulani surprises.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Our goal, first and foremost, is to help families create memories,” said Joe Medwetz, senior sales and services director at Aulani, and board member at Make-A-Wish Hawaii. “We love to see the joy on the children&#8217;s faces when their dreams come true at Aulani.”</p>

The unforgettable week was jam-packed with magical touches, including a dinner party with Stitch and Angel, a Halloween Dance Party and the famous <a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/activities/luau/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1026230024A">KA WA‘A Lū‘au</a>!</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>During the week, I met 11-year-old wish kid Elijah. While fighting an aggressive form of bone cancer, his life was changed by a music therapist, whose guitar melodies provided solace and momentarily interrupted his pain. Music is a beautiful and meaningful part of Hawaiian culture, and you’ll often hear the delightful chords of the ‘ukulele, one of the islands’ most popular instruments, fill Aulani Resort – the perfect wish fit for Elijah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Disney’s animated film &#8220;Moana,&#8221;<em> </em>while entirely fictional, is based on the legends and cultures of several prominent Polynesian nations, such as Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. Recently, a cast member at <a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0504230510230008E">Aulani, A Disney Resort &amp; Spa</a> found herself following in Moana’s figurative footsteps, albeit in a less dramatic way. She didn’t have to steal Maui’s fishhook from a giant coconut crab, nor fight off hordes of Kakamora, but her journey of self-discovery was no less moving, and the lessons she learned no less valuable.</p>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mp_14378463287946.jpeg" alt="Moli at Tradewind Hotel" class="wp-image-317896" /><figcaption>Sightseeing in Aua, American Samoa</figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Moli Mapu is a manager at Aulani Resort’s <a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/spa-fitness/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0504230510230009E">Laniwai Spa</a>. She was born in American Samoa, the daughter of a prominent leader in the village of Aua on the main island of Tutuila. Despite American Samoa’s status as an unincorporated US territory, most villages adhere to a traditional governing structure called the <em>Matai Chief System</em> in which certain individuals are chosen by families to oversee and guide each village. Known as high talking chiefs, their duty is to take care of their village &#8220;aiga&#8221; (extended family), bring them together to mark events and maintain harmony. For example, the high talking chief will call the family together to help when there is a funeral, wedding or other event. He oversees the village council, which makes rules concerning all aspects of village life, such as evening curfew, protection of religious rights and the safety of residents. He also hears grievances and settles disputes.</p>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mp_27849075489570.jpeg" alt="Moli presenting a Samoan mat" class="wp-image-317895" /><figcaption>Presenting a Samoan mat during the ceremony honoring her father</figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In September 2022, Moli’s father, Johnny Siaumau Mapu, was elected high talking chief of Aua, an immense honor and one that recognizes years of service to the village, the community, and the nation of American Samoa as a whole. “There is a proverb in Samoa that says <em>o le ala i le pule o le tautua</em>, which means the pathway to leadership is through service,” Moli said. “I was so proud when my father was called to be our village&#8217;s high talking chief. It was one of my favorite moments that I got to witness as his daughter. My father has always been the definition of service to me. For as long as I can remember, I have watched him serve wholeheartedly in many capacities – the church, the army, advocating for veterans. To watch him humbly accepting another opportunity to serve his &#8220;aiga&#8221; and village was beyond words.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>When Moli arrived in American Samoa last September to observe ceremonies honoring her father, it was the first time she’d set foot there in over two decades. She left American Samoa in 2002 as a teenager to further her education in Hawai‘i. While attending Brigham Young University-Hawai‘i, she saw a flyer on campus advertising the <a href="https://jobs.disneycareers.com/job/orlando/disney-college-program/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0504230510230010E">Disney College Program</a> and moved to Orlando in 2008. What was expected to be a six-month internship turned into a three-year stint working for Walt Disney World in roles such as front desk, concierge and VIP services at several Walt Disney World Resort hotels.</p>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mp_34378439427238.jpeg" alt="Moli in Hawai'i" class="wp-image-317894" /><figcaption>Spending some time relaxing with family</figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Still, Hawai‘i called to her. “In 2011, I became homesick and missed my family and Hawai‘i so much. I was fortunate that Aulani Resort was hiring and invited me to be a part of the front office opening team. The rest is history, and this August I will be celebrating 15 years working for the best company in the world,” she said.</p>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mp_47584935745874-1024x768.jpeg" alt="Moli sightseeing" class="wp-image-317893" /><figcaption>Enjoying the shoreline breezes</figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Building a life in Hawai‘i left little time to revisit her childhood home. So when she journeyed to Aua in September, she saw it through new eyes as an adult. The aroma from the Starkist tuna factories wafting in the breeze. The decades-old lumpia stand still selling the delicious spring rolls she enjoyed as a child. “All these sights and smells brought back fond childhood memories,” she said. “It was humbling to see how simple life is and how happy and content people are with the little they have. It made me appreciate what I have even more.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The visit also gave Moli a new appreciation for her heritage and the customs she may have once taken for granted. “I definitely gained greater insight into the culture. I witnessed so many acts of service, kindness, and love, especially as everyone came together to honor my father. I am proud to come from a heritage where these important values are at the core of everything,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mp_57584953749852.jpeg" alt="Moli and her family" class="wp-image-317892" /><figcaption>Moli Mapu (far right) with her sister, Uheina Mapu Ah You (far left), stepmother, Lisa Vasai Mapu, and father, Dr. Johnny Siaumau Mapu</figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Now that her father is a high talking chief, is she a princess? “No, I’m not,” she said with a laugh. “There are village maidens called <em>taupou</em> that are similar to what Moana is, but that doesn’t apply to me. <em>Taupou</em> are designated by other high chiefs, but my father doesn’t determine that.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>She may not technically be royalty, but Moli certainly carries herself with the grace, humility, and appreciation of her people and customs befitting a princess.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In Hawai‘i, there is an <em>‘ōlelo no&#8217;eau</em>, a wise saying, that Disney&#8217;s Animals, Science and Environment (ASE) team at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/destinations/aulani/" target="_blank">Aulani Resort</a> has adopted: <em>He aliʻi ka ʻāina, he kauwā ke kanaka</em>. The land is a chief, man is her servant. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>ASE cares for all of the fish at Aulani Resort, including those at Rainbow Reef snorkeling lagoon. In every aspect of their roles, these cast members work to uphold this tradition of serving the land &#8211; or, more specifically, the water. This Earth Month, I wanted to share some insight into a unique and innovative program created by ASE that elevates this purpose even further.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FS45328429879472974922222.jpg" alt="Aulani Resort’s Rainbow Reef fish and cast members" class="wp-image-315507" /><figcaption>Animal &amp; Water Science Manager Raffy Jacinto and Senior Aquarist Eric Curtis look over Rainbow Reef</figcaption></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>You see, the team does such a good job caring for our finned friends that these fish are constantly spawning or laying eggs. So many, in fact, that it spurred an idea.&nbsp;What if these eggs could be harvested and hatched? Could this be a way to help replenish tropical fish stocks without impacting the ocean environment?&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The idea turned into a pilot program with Oceanic Institute of Hawaiʻi Pacific University (OI), a research facility dedicated in part to aquaculture, or breeding fish. Aulani Resort provides the fish eggs to OI, and they in turn attempt to hatch and grow them. Over the past few years, the program has seen some surprising and optimistic results, including landmark strides in the successful breeding of the milletseed butterflyfish, the Potter&#8217;s angelfish, and the Hawaiian cleaner wrasse, all fish that historically have had only very rare success breeding under managed care. These successes have the potential to lessen the number of fish being taken out of natural reefs around the world. “Aulani Resort’s Rainbow Reef has allowed us to work with species we did not have access to and enabled us to expand our research and conservation efforts,” said Chad Callan, director of OI’s finfish program.</p>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FS6427868762864828842222.jpg" alt="Aulani Resort’s Rainbow Reef fish and cast members" class="wp-image-315508" width="380" height="675" /><figcaption>Eric Curtis collects fish eggs from Rainbow Reef with the help of Water Science/Dive Technician Nick Grinwis</figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>So what does this mean for Aulani Resort and Rainbow Reef? Dr. Geoff Pye, Disney’s Animal Health Director, explains. “One of the things that Disney is committed to, whether it’s The Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends at EPCOT in Florida or Aulani Resort in Hawaii, is that we really want to promote sustainability and ensure that the impact we’re having is a positive one,” he said. “The fact that we are now engaged in a project to raise young fish under managed care and not having to collect them from the environment is awesome.”</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FS54875623634286847268.jpg" alt="Aulani Resort’s Rainbow Reef fish" class="wp-image-315509" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Dr. Geoff believes this research can have far-reaching implications. “I see a time when aquariums are going to be fully sustainable. And I think we’re close to reaching a tipping point where we could soon be able to raise hundreds of species of fish, and at that point, there’s the possibility that some of these fish could replenish wild populations. And that’s really exciting.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>For now, OI has made arrangements to send the fish originating from eggs in Rainbow Reef to other accredited aquariums across the country. In Hawaii, collecting fish for aquarium use is banned, making this effort even more critical to sustain the fish populations in managed care, including those at Rainbow Reef. There are limited species available based on the success rates of those being bred, however Aulani Resort’s work with OI is changing that. It’s the hope of everyone involved that the fish born from this program will act as ambassadors of Hawaii, helping to educate even more guests about Hawaii’s fragile reef environment and how to protect our precious natural resources.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>And while some of the fish go on to be world travelers, others continue their mission right here at home. Recently a special delivery at Aulani Resort &#8212; several fish born from the Rainbow Reef eggs &#8211; came back to grow up in Rainbow Reef.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>On your next visit to Aulani Resort, be sure to visit our finned ambassadors at Rainbow Reef, and learn more about ocean conservation and the role they are playing in it.</p>

We are so excited for you to enjoy all the beauty, stories and rich culture Aulani Resort has to offer. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>To help you make the most of your time, we’ve
compiled a list of some of our favorite recreational activities at this
one-of-a-kind resort! </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We’ve also sprinkled a little extra pixie
dust around the resort to create a few unique opportunities for some extra
“Membership Magic” for our Disney Vacation Club Members. </p>
</div>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Explore the beauty of Hawai<em>ʻ</em>i</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Taking into consideration the beautiful natural landscape and the local culture, Walt Disney Imagineers created Aulani Resort as a truly special place that celebrates the beauty of the islands.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Discover all of the special details with a guided <em>Māka‘ika‘i</em> (tour or sightsee) during your stay. There are three different complimentary (!) tour options:</p>
</div>

<div class="block-list">
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/activities/makaikai-nature-wildlife/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0302230019A">Māka‘ika‘i, the Nature and Wildlife of Aulani Resort:</a></strong> This tour takes guests on a walking tour through the resort for an in-depth look at the perfectly curated balance of manmade structures and natural surroundings. An entertaining guide will also highlight the broad canopy of the Waikolohe Valley, the lush space full of “mischievous waters” between the two towers, and the other beautiful natural spaces that call Aulani home.</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="block-list">
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/activities/makaikai-arts-culture-tour/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0302230020A">Māka‘ika‘i, The Art of Aulani Resort:</a> </strong>During the design of Aulani Resort, Walt Disney Imagineers reached out to local artists to help tell the stories of Hawai‘i throughout the resort. This tour offers guests the chance to see how this inspiration helped bring the resort to life. Along the way, a guide will showcase unique interior design aspects, dramatic storytelling murals and one of the largest collections of contemporary Hawaiian artwork on the islands. </li></ul>
</div>

<div class="block-list">
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://disneyvacationclub.disney.go.com/discounts-perks-offers/member-experiences/art-nature-walking-tour-aulani?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0302230021A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Member Māka‘ika‘i: Art &amp; Nature Trail</a>:</strong> Every afternoon from 2-2:45 p.m., Disney Vacation Club Members can enjoy a member-exclusive tour through the resort. Guests will leisurely make their way through beloved resort locations to learn more about the landscape, nature, features and design.</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Be sure to check the Daily <em>‘Iwa</em> (aka Aulani’s daily activities schedule) for available tour times.&nbsp;The schedule is available at locations around the resort or on the <a href="https://www.disneyaulani.com/aulani-resort-app/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0302230022A">Aulani Resort mobile app</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Discover new surprises </strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Have you heard of the Menehune? According to local legend, they are the mischievous, shy and maybe even a little magical beings of Hawai‘i. They are known for their skilled craftsmanship, evidence of which may be found by curious guests throughout Aulani Resort.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>And if you’re in the mood for more exploring,
the Menehune Adventure Trail can take you on a high-tech, interactive scavenger
hunt for enchanting surprises! Explorers will use a special tablet to solve
riddles, discover hidden wonders and learn about Hawaiian history and culture
along the way. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Guests of all ages are invited to enjoy this
complimentary experience, but some clues may be better suited for kids who are
a little bit older (pre-teen age). Disney Vacation Club Members have extended
Member Magic Hours, during which they have exclusive access to the experience
outside of normal operating hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</div>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Welcome home celebration </strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We love to roll out the red carpet for our Disney Vacation Club Members, and what better way to say “<em>E komo mai</em>” (welcome home) than to throw a welcome home party?! Every week, members (and their non-member guests) are invited to a private celebration with an exciting trivia game, tasty refreshments and a dance party with a few magical guests!</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Plus, partygoers will have a chance to learn
more about exciting Disney Vacation Club updates and ask questions to make sure
they’re making the most of their time. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Remember: this is an exclusive event and
space is limited! Make sure to check in with a cast member to RSVP and learn
more about the date, time and location of the celebration during your stay. </p>
</div>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn the </strong><strong>‘ukulele</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Music is a beautiful and meaningful part of Hawaiian
culture. You’ll often hear the delightful chords of the ‘ukulele, one of the islands’ most
popular instruments, fill Aulani Resort. Good news—our talented cast members in
the Pau Hana Room are there to help you learn how to play this fun instrument! </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>During this 45-minute experience, cast members will share the history of several traditional Hawaiian instruments and you’ll learn a few chords on the ‘ukulele! By the end of the class, you’ll be able to play along with some of today’s popular songs.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Plus, if you loved your experience, you can purchase a ‘ukulele after your class. For Disney Vacation Club Members, you’ll receive a free set of replacement strings with your purchase!</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>A hui hou</em>! We hope to see you again real soon!</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The magic of Aulani Resort is endless for our
guests and Disney Vacation Club Members! These exciting experiences are just
the tip of the iceberg of family fun to be had on your enchanting Hawai‘i
