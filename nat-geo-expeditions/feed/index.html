These three new Signature Land trips will take you into authentic Nat Geo storytelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Curious to explore the world but short on&nbsp;time?&nbsp;<a href="http://www.natgeodaytoursbytui.com/">National Geographic Day Tours</a>,&nbsp;operated by TUI,&nbsp;recently added half-day and full-day land itineraries to their portfolio, and we’re excited to share the details with you!&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>More than 40 new&nbsp;shorter time-block tours are available within the National Geographic Day Tours portfolio of 100-plus land and shore excursions in&nbsp;14 countries&nbsp;throughout the world. The small-group tours are based on National Geographic’s extraordinary legacy of storytelling and exploration, plus they are led by National Geographic-trained guides!</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Opening Doors of Discovery Around the Globe</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>National Geographic Day Tours offer a&nbsp;wide array of topics, including nature, conservation, photography, culture, gastronomy and history. Most trips feature local specialists — such as archaeologists, marine biologists, chefs, farmers, photographers, historians, scholars and more — who will illuminate each experience with their expertise and storytelling.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Here are a few of the amazing new land tours.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>National Geographic Day Tours Does the Planning for You</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>When I learned about these new shorter time block tour options with the added bonus of direct booking, I immediately recalled when I’ve traveled on vacation or for business and had a small window of opportunity to explore on my own. Just like many of you, I’d search on my phone, map out nearby places that would allow me to encounter the destination’s highlights and local culture for the day, then figure out all the details.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>This is where National Geographic Day Tours shine. It’s easy to sign up and go!&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.natgeodaytoursbytui.com/us">website</a>&nbsp;allows you to sort by destination, date or inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>These authentically National Geographic experiences are incredible opportunities to take deep dives into subjects and places with access I could never achieve on my own. The portfolio is unique, fascinating and brimming with discovery, plus knowledgeable trip planning experts have organized all the details.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Giving Back and Traveling with Purpose</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>I’m also thrilled to share that National Geographic Day Tours furthers the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/society/our-explorers/">National Geographic Explorers</a> around the world.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Hello, travelers!</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Imagine taking one trip and visiting three picturesque European countries, each with centuries old history, where you’ll tour a 14th-century castle, visit the entire region’s largest market and bazaar, explore caves, and walk the cobblestone streets in some of the best preserved Medieval cities in the world. And lots more!</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Are you ready to see the Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia?&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/">National Geographic Expeditions</a> recently announced this amazing trip as part of a trio of new itineraries with departures beginning in 2024: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/asia/land/bhutan-land-of-mysticism-and-mythology/">Bhutan</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/south-america/land/colombia-connections-to-the-land-and-the-past/">Colombia</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/estonia-lithuania-and-latvia-enchanted-forests-and-medieval-ca/">the Baltics</a>. Today it’s my pleasure to share a closer look at the Baltics. The beauty and significance of these countries are inspirational for enthusiasts of dramatic architecture, history and nature. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Visiting the Baltics is an embrace of cultures and traditions. Historical centers are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and yet there is also a modern twist matching today’s lifestyle. I’m happy to report that the cities which are hundreds of years old and the region’s cultural centers remain front-and-center on this 11-day tour! It’s truly an enchanting experience and a step back in time, especially when visiting the castles. Plus, you’ll have a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/">National Geographic Expert</a>&nbsp;on this expedition to provide unique insights and an Expedition Leader to take care of the travel details …so you don’t have to!&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>First Stop: Lithuania, the Southernmost Baltic State</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Your trip begins in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital, and a visit to St. Anne’s Church, Gediminas Tower and Gates of Dawn. A privately guided tour of the Grand Duke Palace and a fascinating talk by your National Geographic Expert will propel your exploration of this city, historically traced back to 1569 as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the evening, you’ll have time to explore Lithuania on your own or with your travel-mates.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BP63746378628746376487333.jpg" alt="Trakai Castle Image - Travel to The Baltics with National Geographic" class="wp-image-321136" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The next day, be prepared to be awestruck by the Trakai Castle which sits on a small island in Lake Galve. During a privately guided tour, you’ll learn that the construction of this beautiful red Gothic brick castle commenced in the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>14th century and how it survived attacks in the 1300s. Its first two phases were completed around 1409, the third phase in the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>15th century and it was rebuilt in the 1950s. Today, its beauty stands as a testament to the Lithuanian people. You will also visit the Ninth Fort and learn of its somber history as you stop at the Monument for the Commemoration of the Holocaust Victims.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BP63726476274987948729.jpg" alt="Sea and Clouds in Image - Travel to The Baltics with National Geographic " class="wp-image-321133" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>During the following two days, you’ll enjoy a ferry ride to the Curonian Spit, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a visit to the Amber Museum, and the Hill of Crosses – all immersive experiences in local culture with tremendous landscape views.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Discover Latvia and Its Coastal Peninsula</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Latvia is known for its wide beaches, sprawling forests and stunning architecture.&nbsp;The country also boasts an incredible lineup of UNESCO World Heritage Sites that you’ll explore along the way, including the 18th-century Rundale Palace (often called the Versailles of the Baltics) and its collection of more than 2,300 varieties of roses, Riga Castle and Riga Central Market, the largest market and bazaar in Europe. I hope you leave some extra space in your suitcase!</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>But we’re not done with castles yet! You’ll enjoy privately a guided tour of the medieval Cesis Castle, one of Latvia’s most iconic and best-preserved castles, before heading to the Gutmanus Cave and a ride on the Gauja Valley cable car through the Gauja National Park. </p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BP9374837847673846837.jpg" alt="Gauja National Park, Fields and Mountains in Image - Travel to The Baltics with National Geographic" class="wp-image-321135" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Estonia: The Northernmost Baltic State Bordering the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, is surrounded by the water to the north and to the west. Here, you’ll be captivated by the architectural details. In Tallinn, you’ll tour the Art Nouveau district, and in the coastal town of Parnu enjoy a walk among the timbered villas and neoclassical spa buildings. Back in Tallinn, the winding cobblestone streets of Old Town and the Medieval Tallinn in Old Town seemingly transport you to another time.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>At the Rocca al Mare district in Tallinn on the picturesque Kopli Bay, a visit to the Estonian Open Air Museum inspires with its living museum of the people and cultures across Estonia. The museum is a representation of life dating back to the 18th century, including farmhouses, a church, schoolhouse, fire station, fishing sheds and more.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>National Geographic Expeditions Takes Travelers Around the World</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The highlights above are just a sampling of places you’ll visit! There is much to experience in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>With hundreds of trips and more than 140 itineraries to choose from, National Geographic Expeditions takes travelers to all seven continents and to more than 80 destinations around the world. Access and knowledge are foundational to each itinerary, plus a portion of every trip booked goes back to support the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/why-choose-nat-geo/nat-geo-society-mission/">National Geographic Society</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p><em>¡Nos vamos a Colombia!</em> From gorgeous coastlines to lively culture, Colombia is one of the most unique, historic and diverse countries in the world. With its history dating back thousands of years, there is so much to see, taste and experience — so why not explore it with the leading experts who can bring the location to life? That’s where <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/">National Geographic Expeditions</a> comes in.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We’re excited to share that our new Signature Land trip, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/south-america/land/colombia-connections-to-the-land-and-the-past/">Colombia: Connections to the Land and the Past</a>, will embark in 2024! This nine-day, eight-night itinerary is bursting with exciting activities and learning opportunities – perfect for curious explorers. Plus, traveling with a National Geographic Expert <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/"></a>will take you deeper into Colombian culture.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Fascinating behind-the-scenes insight from the Experts help to set up the experiences in the days ahead. From photographers to naturalists and local experts, these expeditions are brimming with access and knowledge!</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let’s Begin in Bogota</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>There’s no better place to kick off this itinerary than in the country’s capital: Bogota. This bustling and beautiful hub has so much to offer travelers.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Start your day at Paloquemao Market, one of the largest food markets in Bogota. With a private tour, you’ll navigate the aisles as you sample delicious fresh fruits, and not only admire but also learn about the diversity of the vibrant local flowers that fill the market – all before embarking on a walking tour of the city’s historic plazas and landmarks.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In the afternoon, enjoy a tour of Museo del Oro (an amazing collection of pre-Columbian gold relics from indigenous Muisca people), then settle back into the comfort of the hotel for an impactful talk from a National Geographic Expert – the first of three fascinating Expert talks along the way.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get Caffeinated in the Coffee Region</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Have you ever thought about where your morning cup of joe originated from? Now you can experience coffee production first-hand at a fourth-generation, family-owned coffee farm in the Coffee Cultural Landscape of Colombia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is an incredible chance to understand the process – from growing beans to roasting – in one of the top coffee-producing countries in the world.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Discover Biodiverse and Beautiful Surroundings</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Your expedition will also take you to breathtaking natural areas, such as the Cocora Valley. This lush green valley is home to towering, 125-foot wax palms, Colombia’s national tree. Colombia is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world – so this is a nature-lover’s dream.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Then, you’ll explore Tayrona National Park with a naturalist, hearing all about the surrounding environment. Be on the lookout for endemic cotton-top tamarins and more than 280 species of birds! Nearby, you’ll also visit Taironaka Village, where you can see the ruins of a historic indigenous community and meet members of the Kogi community, who are descendants of the Tairona culture.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Channel Your Inner Explorer</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Other unique cultural experiences include a visit to the Carnaval Museum in Barranquilla, where travelers will hear about the iconic celebration recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. Towards the end of the trip, you&#8217;ll take a closer look into important history, famed architecture and local fare while exploring Cartagena.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>From a walking tour of the historic Walled City to following the footsteps of the influential Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Márquez, there’s so much to do and see in this area.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>On the final full day, you’ll take a short coach ride to nearby San Basilio de Palenque, known for being the first free town for enslaved people in the Americas. Here, you’ll learn about its rich African roots and music, taste regional food and even step into the ring at a local boxing studio.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are You Ready for the Expedition of a Lifetime?</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We can’t wait for you to enjoy all that the National Geographic Expeditions Colombia itinerary has to offer in 2024.</p>

<p>Season’s greetings from Germany, Austria and Vienna! We may be in the heat of summer, but I’m dreaming of a winter wonderland. And Jessica Van Gessel, destination manager for <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0615230621230006E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Geographic Expeditions</a>, recently told us about a Central European trip filled with holiday cheer.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cm_43724982304782.jpg" alt="Jessica in front of a tree and a tree in a city" class="wp-image-320361" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Last year, Jessica explored Christmas markets from Budapest to Munich on the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/river/danube-christmas-markets-river-cruise/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0615230621230004E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Danube Christmas Markets River Cruise</a>. She took the trip because she loves traveling, and although she’s been to Europe, she had never experienced the crisp winter air of the holidays abroad.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Christmas is my favorite season,” Jessica said. “It celebrates family traditions and customs passed down through generations.”</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cm_463782946378642.jpg" alt="Christmas ornaments, pastries and cookies" class="wp-image-320363" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Christmas markets were lined with intricate handmade ornaments, nutcrackers and toys, and traditional treats that called out to her as she strolled along.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In Budapest she tried lángos, a flatbread with sour cream, cheese and smoked salmon. And when it came to sweets, she couldn’t resist the wide variety of chimney cakes, which are fresh pastries, covered in cinnamon sugar or sometimes filled with cream or chocolate.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“The culture is so different from ours,” Jessica said. “The depth of the stories they carry behind their traditions is absolutely magical.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>But some traditions cross borders. During the cruise she enjoyed a familiar custom passed down from her great grandparents, honoring Saint Nicholas Day.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“We grew up putting out our stockings over the fireplace and getting small treats, fruits, or toys on December 6,” Jessica remembers. “For my family, this really was the beginning of Christmas and made us so excited for the rest of the season.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>On her National Geographic Expedition, the tradition carried over to the river cruise where they put their shoes outside the door for St. Nick to visit overnight.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“We woke up to find our shoes filled with candies and chocolate,” Jessica said. “This was so much fun and a great way to celebrate very traditional customs.”</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>With all of the festive fun, Jessica also had to take advantage of the stop in Salzburg, Austria. She grew up watching “The Sound of Music,” her mom’s favorite movie, so exploring the iconic locations made the trip even more memorable.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Growing up watching the movie and then seeing the places where it took place, you have the mountains behind you… It looks fake, but it’s not,” Jessica explained. “That was probably my favorite day.”</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cm_43782949326784.jpg" alt="Jessica aboard a ship and a city skyline" class="wp-image-320362" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Jessica’s traveled plenty on her own, but she notes that traveling with Disney is a league of its own.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“You’re gliding along the Danube River through different countries,” Jessica explained. “Anything you could possibly want to see is laid out for you to experience. It’s worth it to leave your cares behind.” Which is a big part of her job when she’s not on vacation.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>If you look at Jessica’s Disney journey, National Geographic Expeditions was always a natural fit. She started at Disney&#8217;s Animal Kingdom Lodge working with cultural representatives from Africa, and with a background in marine biology, eventually moved into animal care. In leadership positions at EPCOT, she learned even more from cast about their rich cultures.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Getting to know the cast members coming over from all those different parts of the world, was so rewarding,” Jessica shared.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>On the operations side of National Geographic Expeditions, she now works with international partners to make sure guest itineraries are buttoned up. From flights and passports to payments and negotiating dates for future experiences, the job serves her love of travel, culture and staying busy!</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“We have different trips going all over the world every day,” Jessica explained. “This role speaks to who I am at my core. I’m learning a new part of the world every day.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>When we recently announced that <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/asia/land/bhutan-land-of-mysticism-and-mythology/">National Geographic Expeditions</a> is taking travelers to Bhutan beginning in 2024, a friend immediately called me and said it was on her bucket list. And she wasn’t the only one!</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Visiting this country on the Himalayan mountains’ eastern edge offers views of dramatic landscapes and stunning architecture. You’ll be immersed in centuries-old traditions ardently protected by its government and its people, and you’ll meet with Bhutanese dignitaries offering once-in-a-lifetime conversations as you learn about this unique country. National Geographic’s trusted reputation has opened doors, and National Geographic Expeditions has developed an amazing itinerary for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Let’s take a look at what you will experience in Bhutan with National Geographic Expeditions. These are just highlights of all the amazing sights and experiences you’ll encounter, so be sure to see our <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/asia/land/bhutan-land-of-mysticism-and-mythology/">website</a> for a complete and detailed itinerary.</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/iu17o3ritygkh3jl2g235hergvfs1.jpg" alt="Photo Credit: National Geographic Expeditions" class="wp-image-320134" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Photo Credit: National Geographic Expeditions</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bhutan: Land of Mysticism and Mythology</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Your first day in Bhutan includes a visit to a monastery where a monk will offer a blessing for safe travels. This blessing is a common Bhutanese practice and is your introduction to the local culture.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Your journey on this 11-day excursion continues to Thimphu, the Phobjika Valley, Punakha and Paro.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In Thimphu, you’ll stop at the Zangdok Pelri Temple, see the 169-foot Buddha Dordenma statue, hear from Buddhist practitioners and even participate in a butter lamp lighting ceremony. Following lunch, at the Institute of Thirteen Arts and Crafts, you’ll see amazing artwork and a traditional painting demonstration. One of the most significant elements of this trip happens at the Folk Heritage Museum. Here you’ll meet with a member of the King’s Court for a question-and-answer session followed by dinner at the museum.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Next, the beautiful Dochula Pass and its spectacular views will greet you as you stand in awe of the Himalayan mountains. In the Phobjikha Valley, touring a 450-year-old monastery, hiking in the forested areas to spot birds and wildlife, plus visiting a local farming community and having butter tea and lunch with a local farmer are just a few of the special moments in this region. You’ll also learn about the Black-Necked Crane and the local efforts to preserve and protect their roosting areas.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In Punakha, you’ll engage with local villagers as you explore the countryside, Buddhist monasteries, the 520-foot suspension bridge, and the Punakha Dzong, an architectural wonder and the most important fortress in Bhutan.</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/iu17o3ritygkh3jl2g235hergvfs3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-320136" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Photo Credit: National Geographic Expeditions</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Paro is also a delight. Here, you’ll tour the National Museum to view the finest Bhutanese art collection of more than 3,000 pieces spanning 1,500 years of the country’s history, and you’ll visit the iconic Tiger’s Nest Monastery.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>This is a dream trip for many reasons — the country has long protected its culture and has limited tourism. Known for its Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index, tourism and overall lifestyle are closely monitored by the government to contribute to the collective happiness of its people. For example, there are nine key markers that are measured, including culture, community and the environment.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>If you’re an Indiana Jones fan (who isn’t?), here’s a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2023/05/7-ways-to-travel-like-indiana-jones-with-national-geographic-expeditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where&nbsp;you can go</a> with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/">National Geographic Expeditions</a>&nbsp;to travel like Indy. You can also discover some of the amazing wonders of the world alongside the real-life Indiana Joneses — aka the archaeologists and educators searching for new discoveries and preserving history around the globe!</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Just think – you could witness prehistoric cave art in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/human-origins-france-spain/">Spain and France</a>, experience the rich culture and history of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/africa/land/morocco-tour/">Morocco</a>&nbsp;or learn about ancient&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/africa/land/egypt-group-giza-pyramids-museum-tours/">Egyptian</a>&nbsp;practices from an expert who has spent a good portion of their career literally <em>digging</em>&nbsp;into that subject matter.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We got to connect with three of our current National Geographic Experts: Ana Pinto, William Saturno and Magen O’Farrell. Believe me,&nbsp;their lives and archaeological work is just as exciting as it sounds! Here is what they had to say:</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/II92738628753765237265372.jpg" alt="Ana Pinto, Anthropologist and Archaeologist" class="wp-image-319964" width="338" height="395" /></figure></div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/ana-pinto/"><strong>Ana Pinto</strong></a><strong>, Anthropologist and Archaeologist</strong></p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q:&nbsp;What inspired you to be an archaeologist?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>When I was young, I wanted to be one of those commanding Jules Verne characters – boldly undertaking amazing world adventures. Years later, I was starting on my PhD in cultural anthropology when the Atapuerca team landed in our university, and that was the turning point for me. I completed the specialization for Prehistory and Archaeology, and I haven’t looked back (or up) ever since.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Tell us about your favorite project.</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Undoubtedly, my favorite project is my own site: the Sopeña rock shelter in the mountains of northern Spain. I discovered that site, am the excavation director and the principal investigator of the research project. National Geographic Society has funded the excavation season at Sopeña on two different occasions, which makes me very proud.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What National Geographic Expeditions have you been on / are you going to be on?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>From its creation, I have been a National Geographic Expert on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/human-origins-france-spain/">Human History: Northern Spain and Southwest France</a>&nbsp;Expedition. Starting in Atapuerca, we move northwards to visit all the main prehistoric rock art caves in Spain and France. This itinerary was designed by the famous Dr. Donald Johanson, one of the greatest archaeologists and palaeoanthropologists of our time, and the discoverer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/lucy-facts-on-early-human-ancestor">Lucy the Australopithecus</a>. Believe me, I never get tired of seeing those wondrous rock art caves (that are part of the expedition experience). I feel really privileged and doubt that many archaeologists have ever had the chance of visiting them as often as I have.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is your favorite part of traveling with others and sharing your insights on an expedition?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>When people choose to travel with National Geographic, it says that they are passionate about exploration, research, knowledge and all the wonders of the planet. I share my passion with them, and they really enjoy it. It is very fulfilling for me to see others’ understanding of complex scientific methods.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Why (in your opinion) should people consider traveling with an archaeologist?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We archaeologists build a story with what very little remains of the past we have, but this story is always relative to something true, and it keeps changing as new techniques develop. When traveling with an archaeologist, you not only get “the story,” but you also get all the “ifs” which fills your experience with so much more depth and understanding.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is your favorite &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; movie?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>I love all the &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; movies. The settings are great. The plot is fantastic. And adventure, exploration and discovery are all a large part of them. Perhaps “Raiders of the Lost Ark” is my favorite. As an archaeologist, I have always found it very funny that Indy’s main professional tool is the whip instead of, say, the sieve.</p>

</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong><strong>What inspired you to be an archaeologist?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>My inspiration to be an archaeologist is a bit of a tough one to pin down,&nbsp;mainly&nbsp;because it was one of the first things I ever wanted to be. My first actual excavations took place at the&nbsp;University of Arizona Field School at Grasshopper Spring Pueblo on the White Mountain Apache Reservation. It was everything I had long dreamed archaeology to be.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Tell us about your favorite project.&nbsp;</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In 2010, one of my field school students reported to have found a new set of wall paintings at the nearby site of&nbsp;Xultun (Shool-toon). In reality, all he found was a single faded line of red paint, but on Easter Sunday, when everyone else had the day off, I went out to the site with him and a few graduate students just to check things out. I decided to&nbsp;excavate a little further into the room to define its size. At the very least we would be able to say that the room was &#8220;x by y&#8221; feet and was&nbsp;painted in antiquity, though none of that painting preserved till today. When I excavated to the back wall of the room, removing the fill just with my fingertips, I burst out laughing as I uncovered the portrait of a Maya king.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>I returned with National Geographic support to fully&nbsp;excavate, document and conserve the find. After 10 years administering a large archaeological project at San Bartolo, being able to get back to the art of excavating and uncover this second set of paintings in the company of only my closest&nbsp;colleagues, my son and a&nbsp;National Geographic&nbsp;photographer was in the end my favorite of all Nat Geo projects.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What National Geographic Expeditions have you been on / are you going to be on?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>I have been on countless expeditions since 2013 when I hosted my first expedition bringing&nbsp;travelers to San Bartolo Xultun in Guatemala. Since then, I have done land and sea expeditions throughout the following:</p>

Since then, I have done land and sea expeditions throughout <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/iceland-volcanoes-glaciers-tour/">Iceland</a>, Norway, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/hiking-scotland/">Scotland</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/train/swiss-italy-train/">Switzerland</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/spain-walking-el-camino/">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/ancient-greece-trip/">Greece</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/italy-vatican-city-and-sistine-chapel-tours/">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/ocean/coastal-gems-of-croatia-slovenia-aboard-sea-cloud-ii/">Croatia</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/ocean/greece-dalmatian-cruise/">Albania</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/africa/land/egypt-group-giza-pyramids-museum-tours/">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/africa/land/morocco-tour/">Morocco</a>, and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/asia/land/china-terracotta-warriors-tour/">China</a>.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is your favorite part of traveling with others and sharing your insights on an expedition?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>My very favorite part of traveling with others is seeing their eyes fill with joy and curiosity when they experience these long-dreamed of places in person for the first time. I live to bring these ancient spaces to life for them, to fill them with the sights and sounds of people not unlike them that spent their lives in these places in antiquity.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Why (in your opinion) should people consider traveling with an archaeologist?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Archaeologists are a special breed because we have to be equally versed in not only the history of a place but its&nbsp;science, arts and material culture down to the most mundane artifacts. We deal with the refuse left by everyone, not just the wealthy or those in charge, but of the mason, farmer and shepherd. All <em>trash</em> is equal in&nbsp;the eyes of an archaeologist.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is your favorite &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; movie?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>It’s really a toss-up between the first and the third. The first film,&nbsp;“Raiders of the Lost Ark” was my&nbsp;absolute favorite until “Indiana Jones and the Last&nbsp;Crusade” was released. The addition of Henry Jones Sr. particularly resonated with me. His origins in the archaeology of the American southwest and following the trail to Italy didn’t hurt either, and Salah, his faithful friend, is a treasure.</p>

</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong><strong>What inspired you to be an archaeologist?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>My first visit to the real Lascaux Cave! In fact, I think I may be the only person to have visited Lascaux and its incredible 20,000-year-old paintings and engravings with no previous idea of what it was. I wasn’t even aware that humans had made any kind of art that long ago, much less the stunning masterpieces that glisten and dance before our eyes as if they were made yesterday. But what moved me most was the surprising and profound sense of oneness I felt with the distant ancestors that made this art — and at the same time, with all humans living today across the globe — reaffirming to me that art is a unique and universal human trait that touches and connects us all, regardless of our nationality, culture, race, politics, religion or philosophy. At that moment, I understood the power of archaeology to reveal and share this invaluable message of human unity, and I knew that this is what I wanted to do.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Tell us about your favorite project.</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Among the many fascinating excavations that I’ve worked on, my favorite was at the rock shelter of Nawarla Gabarnmang in the Northern Territory of Australia. There, our Franco-Australian team worked closely with the Jawoyn aboriginal tribe to understand and preserve the stunning art and informative artifacts there, spanning tens of thousands of years — with one of our main goals being to perpetuate this rich and complex history for the tribe and thus instill their youth with pride in their heritage as they navigate a modern society.</p>

<p>I currently travel on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/spain-walking-el-camino/">Human History: Northern Spain and Southwest France</a>&nbsp;expedition, which I love! Since I’ve lived and worked for 35 years in the southwestern France region we visit on this trip, I adore sharing its incredible prehistoric archaeology and cave art, along with some&nbsp;<em>inside</em>&nbsp;stories… and not to mention the great food! I’ll be on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/spain-walking-el-camino/">Spain: Walking the Camino de Santiago</a>&nbsp;trip for the first time this September!</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is your favorite part of traveling with others and sharing your insights on an expedition?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Where to begin? Meeting and making new friends, of course! I’m passionate about helping people understand how our deep past can inform us about our present and future. We can learn many valuable lessons from our prehistoric ancestors, such as how to live in greater harmony with our environment.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>And then there’s the immense pleasure of witnessing the joy and wonder of the travelers as they discover the incredible cave art, especially when I remind them that they are standing in the very footsteps of the prehistoric artists themselves and feeling many of their same emotions tens of thousands of years later! Many say this is a life-changing experience for them and, for me, that is the cherry on top.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Why (in your opinion) should people consider traveling with an archaeologist?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>First, there are so many archaeology myths to bust! And only an archaeologist can do that for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>As in any field, only an archaeologist can draw you into our research process, thus enabling you to understand what we can and can’t know, and how we know what we know. Sometimes the power of the deep past is in its mystery, stripping away our superficial differences to reveal the underlying traits shared by all humans — in other words, the very essence of humanity! Archaeologists can help you understand how knowing our past can help us to better understand our present and, hopefully, how to make better decisions for our future.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Oh, and then there’s the passion. Archaeologists are very passionate about their work and can bring it to life for you. Oh, and we’re fun, too! There’s lots of great stories to tell.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is your favorite &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; movie?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Honestly, I think I saw only the first one and it was so long ago that I don’t remember many details. Other than that, Indiana is very handsome! There are a lot of archaeology myths in there to bust. But that’s okay! It’s a movie that’s meant to be fun, and fun is always good.</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ready to dress like an archeologist?</strong></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>There’s no better inspiration than the beloved fictional character Indiana Jones, himself.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Pick your preferred style for exploring with the <a href="https://www.uswings.com/product/indiana-jones-vintage-cowhide-leather-jacket/">&#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221;<em>&nbsp;</em>Vintage Cowhide Leather Jacket</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uswings.com/product/indiana-jones-cape-buffalo-a-2-leather-jacket/">&#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221;<em>&nbsp;</em>Cape Buffalo A-2 Leather Jacket</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>by U.S. Wings.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uswings.com/product/indiana-jones-adventure-bag/">Adventure Bag</a>, also by U.S. Wings, is rugged in style, but big enough to hold your valuables for your upcoming expedition.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Kyle Raser always had a personal love for travel. As a Senior Manager for the Trip Operations Land and Cruise team for both <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY21Q4wo1104211110210001E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adventures by Disney</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/?CMP=ILC-DPFY21Q4wo1104211110210002E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Geographic Expeditions</a>, he and his team turn their wanderlust into unforgettable vacations for our guests.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, his role allows him to test the trip experience, where he follows the guest itinerary and information packets to make sure the experience is seamless. The team knows that small details can have a big impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Kyle recently experienced the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/asia/train/india-train-photo-tour/#pricesanddates?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0223230027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">India by Rail Photography Expedition</a> learning first-hand from National Geographic photography expert, Jonathan Kingston. Photography expeditions feature a limited group size who attend mini lectures each day for tips and settings to capture the best images along their journey. Whether traveling with multiple lenses and expensive equipment or armed with only a mobile device, the trip focuses on all levels of photography.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oiuytrewertyuiuytrewertyujiytrewerftgyh.png" alt="" class="wp-image-318768" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Kyle took more than 1,400 photos on this trip and compiled a few of the tips and key takeaways he learned along the way.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tip #1: Storytelling – Try to think about the story you are telling and how you will want someone to experience your photos.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Just as you watch your favorite film and different camera angles help set the scene, you can do that with your photos as well,” Kyle said. “Consider giving your photo collection a sense of time, place and culture to help tell the story.”</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sertyuioiuytrewertyuioiuytrertyuioiuytr.png" alt="" class="wp-image-318769" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tip #2: Capture what’s interesting.</strong>&nbsp;</h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“This may sound simple, but if it’s interesting to you, it will likely be interesting to those viewing your photos,” Kyle said. “At the same time, if it’s not interesting to you, that will definitely impact the photo and how it’s received. Consider taking a subject from multiple angles, lighting and depths.”</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iuytrertyuioiuytrertyuiuytrewertyuiuy.png" alt="" class="wp-image-318770" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tip #3: Learn your equipment.</strong>&nbsp;</h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>While many professional photographers may have equipment and lenses to help get the perfect shot, a large number of everyday photographers have turned to smartphones as their main tool. Look at your device’s camera settings and try different ways to capture the perfect photo. Using mobile tools like exposure, portrait mode and burst can help get the frame you’re looking for — and with most smartphone cameras, these same tools can be used during the editing process to help enhance what you’ve already taken! </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tip #4: Have fun!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Cameras are a great way to capture the amazing places and wonders around the world – whether it’s the Taj Mahal or your kids playing in the backyard. The key is just making sure that you get yourself out there to experience it,” Kyle explained. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Kyle’s taken trips with Disney to Egypt, Italy and Switzerland, but the trip to India opened his eyes to the theory behind the lens. Understanding the culture is the key to taking the best photo.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“There were some technical tips, but a lot of it is about the philosophy behind why you’re taking the photo, and if it effectively tells the story of where you are,” Kyle added.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/zsxdrftyuiuytrewertyuiuytrewertyuiuytrer.png" alt="" class="wp-image-318771" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Kyle is passionate about the effect of travel on personal wellbeing and while traveling with Disney definitely takes you to iconic destinations, it factors in an understanding of local tradition and culture. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“No matter where you travel or how you travel, it changes you,” Kyle said. “Traveling as a tourist is great, but traveling as a local is so important. It gives an appreciation of the culture and the location, but it also makes me appreciate what I have and my own experiences. Ultimately, it gives me an appreciation for the company where I work.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Kyle knew he wanted to work for Disney from the very first <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0223230028">Disney Parks</a> trip he can remember, starting in college at the Disney Store and continuing to learn about the guest experience through roles with attractions, guest relations, resorts and <a href="https://disneyvacationclub.disney.go.com?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0223230029">Disney Vacation Club</a>.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tyuiuytrewertyuiuytrewertyuytrewrt.png" alt="" class="wp-image-318772" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>A Disney fan and travel enthusiast through and through, he’s visited Disney destinations around the globe. He often considers himself just as much a Disney guest as a cast member, which gives him a special lens on these trips.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“I’ve often said I feel lucky to have loved something that has so many professional opportunities. You can’t necessarily make a career out of the things you love, but I just happened to fall in love with a company that offers experiences and joy to people around the world.”&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In the wise words of everyone’s favorite
archaeologist: “If you want to be a good archaeologist, you gotta get out of
the library!” </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>He’s
right! Indiana Jones and his cast of companions have traveled to all corners of
the world to find incredible treasures, captivating generations of audiences as
they journey to exciting places like Peru, Italy, Egypt and more. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>From exploring ancient tombs to venturing deep into the jungle, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/">National Geographic Expeditions</a> brings curious travelers to explore the world &#8211; just like Indy! We’ve compiled a list of trips that will help you experience some of the destinations visited by the renowned hero. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Don’t worry &#8211; your travels will be just as exciting without any of the danger our heroic friend gets himself into. And hopefully, there are no snakes … I hate snakes. </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peru</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/23ir87t6oiyg2kt34g.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-317862" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>It only feels right to start with the opening scene of “Raiders of the Lost Ark”- this excitement is what got us all hooked from the start! During this sequence, we got our first glimpse of the archeologist’s skills as he navigates booby traps inside an ancient Peruvian temple to reach a golden idol. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/south-america/land/peru-machu-picchu-tour/">Peru: Land of the Inca</a> trip and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/south-america/ocean/galapagos-peru-sacred-valley-tour/">Wild Galapagos and Peru Escape</a> Expedition Cruise also brings travelers to amazing ruins and archeological sites &#8211; without booby traps, of course. With the help of local experts, explore archeological sites in the Sacred Valley that have yielded incredible historical insights into a thriving Inca community and see the famous ruins at Machu Picchu. </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Portugal
</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>A
quest to recover a long sought-after artifact finds Indy on board an enemy ship
along the Portuguese coast during a very stormy evening at the beginning of
“Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.” </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The coastline is a beautiful spot to sail, and travelers on the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/ocean/portugal-spain-france/">Culture and Cuisine: From Oporto to Basque Country by Sea</a><strong> </strong>expedition cruise will get to experience that voyage as they make their way from Portugal all the way to Bordeaux, France. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>During their time at port in Lisbon, travelers will learn about
Portugal’s seafaring history with a tour of monuments from the Age of
Exploration, including the 16th-century Belém Tower. This incredible shoreside
UNESCO World Heritage Site was once used to defend the city!</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Egypt</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/23ir87t6oiyg2kt36g.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-317863" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” Indy’s search for
the Ark of the Covenant brings him to Cairo. The <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/africa/land/egypt-group-giza-pyramids-museum-tours/">Egypt: Ancient Wonders of the Legendary Nile</a> trip will head there as well, along with <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/">National Geographic Experts</a> that share rare behind-the-scenes perspectives
and insights. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Just
like Indy and Marion, travelers will discover ancient architectural marvels in
Cairo. Brave explorers will be thrilled to embark on an excursion into an
interior burial chamber inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu, the largest
structure in the Pyramids of Giza.&nbsp; </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Along the way,
travelers also have a chance to discover treasures of their own at a local
market called Khan el-Khalili. This well-known market has a wide variety of
goods for sale and a great selection of food options, just like the one that
Indy and Marion visited.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Still excited to keep exploring after your time in Egypt? There’s an opportunity to extend your trip with a five-day post-trip extension to discover neighboring Jordan, a country with incredible natural wonders and ancient cities. A highlight of the itinerary is a visit to an iconic royal tomb in Petra called The Treasury, which you might recognize as the home of the Holy Grail in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.” Get all of the important details in the extensions section of the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/africa/land/egypt-group-giza-pyramids-museum-tours/">Egypt itinerary</a> page! </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Austria</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>There’s action and betrayal around every corner when Indy ventures into
an Austrian castle to save his father in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”
The duo’s eventual escape by motorcycle, however, leaves the castle in flames. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>National Geographic Expeditions
travelers on the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/river/summer-danube-river-cruise/">Danube
River Cruise: Budapest to Vilshofen</a> will get to enjoy all the beauty and amazing architecture
of nearby castles during their time in Vienna – and you won’t want to miss the
guided tour of Schönbrunn Palace. The property was the summer residence of the imperial family, and
the well-preserved décor truly takes you back in time. </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>India</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In
“Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” Indy and his companions make a crazy descent
into India by jumping out of an airplane on an inflatable raft and sledding
down the side of the Himalayan Mountains. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this
method of exploring this picturesque country, but I CAN recommend exploring
India by train! </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Traveling
to places not easily accessible by road is a huge perk of embarking on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/asia/train/india-train-tour/">India’s Fabled Rajasthan by Rail</a> trip with National Geographic
Expeditions. From meeting locals in small villages to taking in the majesty of
the iconic Taj Mahal, this itinerary helps you experience all the aspects that
make India a can’t-miss country for travelers. </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Italy
</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/23ir87t6oiyg2kt35g.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-317864" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The search for the Holy Grail brought Indy to the city of Venice in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.” Audiences saw the amazing city in a flash as the characters expertly dodged foes through the streets, waterways and even the Venetian catacombs.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Venice is a popular stop on the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/italy-vatican-city-and-sistine-chapel-tours/">Italy: Renaissance Cities
and Tuscan Life</a><strong> </strong>trip with National Geographic Expeditions. During a
guided (and much slower) tour of the city, travelers will explore the UNESCO
World Heritage site with the insights of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/">National Geographic Experts</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Remember the scene where
Indy pops out of a manhole right in the middle of an outdoor café? You probably
won’t see a recreation of this scene during your private, after-hours dinner at
Saint Mark’s Basilica in the very same Piazza San Marco, but it’s always fun to
dream! </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Morocco</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>I
know what you’re thinking, fans. Indiana Jones hasn’t gone to Morocco yet.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>He will soon! The hero is coming back to the big screen for a final time in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which premieres on June 30, 2023 – and we’ve been told that some of the filming happened in beautiful Morocco. It’s time to go set-jetting to this amazing location! </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Have you heard of this trend? Set-jetting is when you visit the places where your favorite movies or shows are filmed, and the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/africa/land/morocco-tour/">Morocco: Legendary Cities and the Sahara</a> trip with National Geographic Expeditions is a great chance to discover the region where the cast and crew filmed the latest installment in this beloved franchise. </p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now,
let’s go see the world! </strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Brave explorers, are any of these places on
your bucket list? You can even <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/">travel with archeologists</a> on select National Geographic Expeditions
