<p>When you hear National Geographic, what is the first thing that comes to mind? For some, it’s the wild animals, the exotic destinations or the yellow border opening the window to new worlds.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>For <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q4wo0905240009H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adventures by Disney</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q4wo0905240010H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Geographic Expeditions</a> Trip Operator, Keith Jacobson, his first thought ties back to an early childhood memory of his grandfather, George, whom he called, “Grandpa Spud.”</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Earliest Memory</h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Grandpa Spud had a studio in his house with a drafting board and art supplies. As a child, Keith would grab paper and draw next to him, where he felt free to play and create.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Around 1987, I was about 10 years old and playing with a wooden tugboat across the floor when I looked up and saw the giant bookcase with that <em>signature</em> yellow,” says Keith, talking about the iconic yellow of the ‘National Geographic’ magazines. “Those magazines were my earliest opening to the world.”</p>
</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Influence on His Disney Career</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Keith would pull the magazines off the shelf and flip through them for hours. “I didn’t realize Nat Geo had an impact on me from reading about these fantastic places all over the world,” he says.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Keith credits his early exposure to travel and exploration to his grandpa’s “National Geographic” magazine collection.</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1638" src="https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3.jpg" alt="Grandpa’s Legacy Inspires Grandson’s Disney Career" class="wp-image-353051" style="width:1098px;height:auto" srcset="https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3.jpg 1920w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3-280x239.jpg 280w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3-505x431.jpg 505w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3-164x140.jpg 164w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3-768x655.jpg 768w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3-1536x1310.jpg 1536w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3-1266x1080.jpg 1266w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Grandpas_Legacy_3-900x768.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure></div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“I would just pull one [magazine] off the bookshelf and never knew where I was going next.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The influence Grandpa Spud had on Keith helped him grow to love sailing, exploring and connecting to the nature of the world around him. As an adult, Keith continued this sense of adventure through his career as an Adventures by Disney and National Geographic Expeditions cast member. He loves sharing these experiences, the locations, the storytelling of it – with people, making him feel at <em>home</em>.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Life as a Disney Cast Member</h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>For over 10 years, Keith has been making magic with Disney and describes himself as a happy person, who is even happier when he’s providing amazing experiences for others.</p>

<p>Now, the question we’ve been waiting for &#8212; <em>why the name “Spud?”</em>&nbsp;Here is what Keith’s father told him:</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Even Spud didn’t know for sure, but he got the name when he was in 4th or 5th grade. Someone changed his real name, George, into Judge. Someone may have misheard that and called him Spud &#8212; which stuck!”</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q2wo0111240001A" target="_blank">Adventures by Disney</a> just announced not one, but two river cruise itineraries to Holland and Belgium beginning in 2025! Get your travel bags ready, because for those who love to travel, these two countries are must-see vacation destinations.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Imagine traveling with family and friends aboard a river cruise ship, bicycling past windmills, marveling at expansive fields of colorful tulips, encountering art and architecture centuries old, sightseeing on canal cruises through big cities and under quaint bridges, and of course, visiting artisanal chocolate and cheese shops to tempt the taste buds.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2p38uf2y7otgb567u935hu1.jpg" alt="Guest on a river cruise looking out the window" class="wp-image-332881" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:16px"><strong>Touring Holland and Belgium</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Holland and Belgium are two distinct countries, yet each is filled with history, inspiration and experiences influenced by Dutch culture. Together they form an amazing picture of old-world charm brought to life through landmarks and the hands-on activities that are part of these special trips.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2p38uf2y7otgb567u935hu2.jpg" alt="Windmills next to a river" class="wp-image-332882" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Each eight-day voyage with Adventures by Disney is packed with incredible sights to see and things to do. No matter which itinerary they choose, guests on both trips will be sure to experience:</p>
</div>

<div class="block-list">
<ul>
<li>18<sup>th</sup> century windmills at Kinderdijk, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</li>



<li>A Royal Delft tour and hands-on painting activity, a time-honored craft since 1653.</li>



<li>A visit to the original residence and workshop of Plantin and Moretus publishing, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, including a printing press demonstration and activity.</li>



<li>The art of Peter Paul Rubens, breathtaking stained glass windows, sculptures and more at Antwerp’s Cathedral of Our Lady, whose Gothic-architecture construction was first started in 1352 and whose belfry is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p><strong>Discovering Holland and Belgium Tour</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>On this traditional Holland and Belgium itinerary, guests also will celebrate the magic of music at the Utrecht Museum Speelklok, stroll through the Castle de Haar – the largest castle in the Netherlands – and learn about Brussels’ influence on comic books or their expertise in chocolate through a chocolate-making workshop. For adult travelers, Adventures by Disney will offer this tour for one adult-exclusive departure.</p>
</div>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" data-id="332883" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2p38uf2y7otgb567u935hu3a.jpg" alt="Tulips in Holland" class="wp-image-332883" /></figure>

</figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:16px"><strong>Embark on the Tulip Tour</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>For those smitten by the brilliance of tulips and flowers, this is the tour for you! The tulip tour will be offered just once per year to capture the splendor of blooming season. Be prepared to be dazzled by Keukenhof’s display of 7 million spring-flowering bulbs and garden art throughout its 79 acres. Visit Hoorn and its expansive rows of tulips in every color, as well as touring a tulip farm to learn about how these flowers are grown and the bulbs are harvested. And the Floralia Flower Show and its more than 1 million tulip bulbs at the Castle of Grand Bigard is sure to be a highlight of this trip.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>There is so much more to each itinerary! For complete details, please <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/trip-types/small-ship-adventures/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q2wo0111240003A">click here</a>.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:16px"><strong>Traveling by River Cruise</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2p38uf2y7otgb567u935hu4.jpg" alt="River cruise boat" class="wp-image-332885" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Traveling aboard a river cruise ship is ideal when seeing the world with family and friends. With Adventures by Disney, meals and activities are included. Guests can truly customize their vacation with on-your-own-time in place of a group-guided excursion. Young travelers, or Junior Adventurers, can even spend an evening together on an Adventure Guide-led activity. And the best part of all, river cruising means only unpacking once as the ship serves as the hotel for the entire trip (easily one of my top reasons for river cruising!).</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:16px"><strong>Traveling with Adventures by Disney </strong><strong></strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>With Adventures by Disney, all of this is possible without the hassle! Disney-trained Adventure Guides lead the way and take care of every detail, bringing the destinations to life through masterful storytelling and in-depth knowledge of the places visited.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>For nearly 20 years, guests with Adventures by Disney have explored some of the most sought-after places in the world. Have you traveled with Adventures by Disney? Share your experiences in the comments below!</p>

There’s so much merry fun to be had along this route, and the talented Adventure Guides have a knack for bringing guests right into the heart of it all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Trying new foods is a great way to experience a country and its culture. If you’ve wanted to experience Colombia and all it has to offer, you’ll be excited to learn about the new&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2023/05/inside-look-at-the-new-adventures-by-disney-colombia-adventure/" target="_blank">Adventures by Disney trip to Colombia</a>&nbsp;we recently shared.&nbsp;This trip is an excellent introduction to the country’s fantastic food, friendly people, joyful music, and astonishing natural beauty. The country also served as inspiration for Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Encanto,” which introduced us to Mirabel and the entire Madrigal family!&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>One of the highlights of the trip is the opportunity to learn to make arepas – a traditional Colombian dish – just like Julieta Madrigal, Mirabel’s mom, did for her family in the film. Just thinking about it made us hungry for arepas! So, we had to ask Colombian-born Disney Chef Danny Contreras for an arepa recipe – a favorite from the EPCOT International Food &amp; Wine Festival recipe vault.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AA296487267846287678268472784.jpg" alt="Arepas on plates" class="wp-image-321412" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Arepas start with three simple ingredients: pre-cooked corn flour, water, and a little fat, such as butter, to bind the dough together. They can be made savory or sweet with meat or cheese. Chef Danny loves to make arepas with his daughter&nbsp;as a way to&nbsp;share his Colombian heritage. Chef Danny’s father was known for saying, “A meal without an arepa isn’t a complete meal.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The recipe I have for you today is filled with pork rillettes, a cooking style for the pork, and topped with hogao, a Colombian tomato-based sauce with garlic and cumin. Hogao is a Colombian tomato-based sauce with garlic and cumin.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Here is a delicious arepa recipe for you to get a taste of Colombia from your own home. Included on&nbsp;the recipe is artwork of Julieta, drawn specially for you by Disney&nbsp;Animation Supervisor&nbsp;Michael Woodside.</p>

<p><a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0525230531230003G">Disneyland Resort</a> sketch artists Jodi Herron and Katie Taylor (above) used 1,923 colored pencils—representing the year The Walt Disney Company was founded—to create a mini replica sketch desk and take first place in this year&#8217;s Environmental Art Challenge.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Every year, this creative challenge invites Disneyland Resort cast members to reuse items found in their areas to create amazing works of art, inspiring others by bringing their love of Disney and the environment together. Jodi and Katie&#8217;s creation was inspired by the <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/100th-anniversary/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0525230531230004G">Disney100 Celebration</a>, depicting sketches of Mickey Mouse throughout the company’s history to commemorate its roots.</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always wanted to do this and we never thought we would win,&#8221; Katie said. &#8220;We were just excited to even participate.&#8221; Katie and Jodi collected pencils for nearly a year in preparation to create their art piece for the cast-exclusive contest during Earth Month.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The pair also incorporated other reused materials from their work area to complete the replica desk, including cardboard, scrap paper and recycled cans. The 28 sketches of Mickey Mouse honor the year Walt created him in 1928—one drawing includes the names of other Disneyland Resort sketch artists, hidden by Jodi and Katie as an Easter egg.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>&#8220;The environment means so much to the both of us,&#8221; Jodi said. &#8220;We recycle everything at work—paper, pencils, cardboard. It all gets saved and reused for another project. All of our damaged scratch paper gets reused for printing or early design stages of sketching.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Megan’s adoptive mom, Anne, booked a trip to Vietnam as part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Southeast Asia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/asia-pacific/cambodia-vietnam-laos-vacations/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0511230517230003E" target="_blank">Southeast Asia</a> itinerary. With multiple adopted children, Anne wants each of them to know the background of where they come from, so she always plans a trip to showcase their birthplace.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/am_4738497328.jpg" alt="Cooking and cultural experiences" class="wp-image-318201" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan and Anne enjoy Adventures by Disney trip activities.</figcaption></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“When I booked our trip, I wanted to try to take Megan to the region where she was born. To show her the place where we became family,” Anne said.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Megan was adopted from a small village outside of Hanoi, Vietnam at a young age. Equipped with only a birth certificate and simple plans to see the place where they first met, she and her mom set off on the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Since Megan was little and as she grew up, it was always her dream to return to Vietnam,” Anne shared. The goal was simple: “Eating the food she loves and having mother-daughter time together.”</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/am_4738942732-1024x485.png" alt="Claudia hotel and trike cycle ride" class="wp-image-318220" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan visits the hotel where she and mom, Anne, first met (left). The pair enjoys a trike cycle ride like they did when Megan was a child (right).</figcaption></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The stop in Hanoi was midway through the itinerary and with the intimate nature of an Adventures by Disney trip, the entire group of guests and guides learned about Megan’s adoption story and were excited to see where their journey would take them.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Stephanie Rohlfs, the adventure guide on the trip, said, “Being even a small part of such a life changing story was special. Watching all of the guests witness Megan’s journey, and seeing it myself, was so moving.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>To ensure the authenticity of the trip, Adventures by Disney hires local guides who are trained by Disney and complete the picture of local language and culture. The local guide on this trip, Tony Pham, is from Hanoi, speaks the language, and immediately knew he wanted to help Megan and Anne learn more.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“We didn’t know what we would find, but I knew that the adventure would be meaningful, so I had to help,” Tony said.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>On a free day of the trip, Tony helped to translate the birth certificate and locate Megan’s province in Hanoi. This led to a car rental, police stations, and the realization that, in a small town everyone knows everyone and with the bonds of family and friends so close, they never really leave. The police recognized the surname and directed them to the correct province.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>They arrived at a local home and as Tony started to speak with a group, a woman’s eyes lit up. She recognized Megan.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Through a language barrier, Megan began to learn her story…</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/am_147389247.jpg" alt="Family reunion in Vietnam" class="wp-image-318199" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan with the extended family who cared for her before adoption.</figcaption></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“I was so lost in the moment when we all met. We didn’t understand each other, but we were all crying and hugging. Without knowing the language, I knew how much she loved me when I was in her arms,” Megan said.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>After Megan was born, her natural mother’s friend – who had recently given birth to a child of her own – took care of her. Another family, who was unable to conceive also fostered her during her toddler years.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“I’ve got my [adoptive] mom, stepmom, foster mom and natural mom,” Megan explained.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The whole village came out to greet Megan, sharing photos from when she was a baby and stories of what she was like as a mischievous toddler.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Her natural, step and foster families had to give her up because they did not have the means to care for her at the time. So, when Megan was around five years old, she was brought to the adoption agency. This is when Anne, who served in the military in Hanoi, met Megan.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/am_47389472384.jpg" alt="Photo album memories" class="wp-image-318202" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan at the age of adoption (left). Anne, Megan and her older sister in Vietnam (right).</figcaption></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The whereabouts of her natural mother are still unknown, but Megan plans to keep in touch with the woman she’s deemed her foster mom and the extended family. She’s even learning Vietnamese to trim down on the language barrier.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“Without the guides encouraging us to keep searching and translating, we would’ve never met my family,” Megan explained. “Now, I fully know who I am and where I come from. My world grew so much wider by finding my family.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Stephanie explained that the connection and personalization of Adventure by Disney trips is why she loves her job.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“You get to do all these amazing things with Adventures by Disney, and that’s why people sign up – for the itinerary and the list of places, sights and activities,” Stephanie said. “But what they walk away with is so much more.”</p>

<p>Are
you wearing green today? I hope so, or else be on the watch for those
mischievous leprechauns! </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Happy St. Patrick’s Day! This fun,
clover-covered holiday is a great time to celebrate Irish culture, lush, green
hills and dales, and the gracious people who welcome us to their beautiful
country. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Irish are known for more than luck. Their tradition of storytelling has kept history and lore alive for centuries. So it’s fitting that today <a href="http://www.adventuresbydisney.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0316230002A">Adventures by Disney</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.com/">National Geographic Expeditions</a> — with their focus on storytelling from Adventure Guides and National Geographic Experts, respectively — invite guests to write their own stories when traveling with us.&nbsp; </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Whether you’re looking forward to exploring
seldom-seen corners of the island or enjoying bustling city life in Dublin,
Adventures by Disney and National Geographic Expeditions have plenty of trip
options. Let’s look at a few of these exciting Irish itineraries where guests
can explore time-honored traditions, trace the paths of the Vikings and Celts,
visit amazing sites and even take an Irish dance lesson.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Castles, Castles, and More Castles! </strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>There are more than 30,000 castles in Ireland, and we’re going exploring! The architectural marvels across the country’s iconic landscape are a must on any trip (we tried to fit in all 30,000 castles but we couldn’t find that four-leaf clover to make it happen). Centuries of history are housed in these incredible stone castles, transporting travelers back in time. Here are just a few stops we’ll experience:</p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Live like Royalty</em></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Not only does the <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/europe/ireland-vacations/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0316230004A">Adventures by Disney Ireland</a> itinerary include a private tour of the grounds at <strong>Dromoland Castle</strong>, but we will also spend three incredible nights at this 15th-century marvel. Surrounded by rolling hills, the castle’s ivy-covered stone towers, pristine gardens and picturesque lake create an ideal backdrop for exploring the property’s regal history. </p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Experience History First-Hand</em></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The beautiful <strong>Kilkenny Castle</strong> was built in the 12<sup>th</sup> century and served as the seat of the Butlers of Ormonde, a notable family that lived there for 600 years. As we travel with the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/land/ireland-trips-and-castle-tours/">National Geographic Expeditions Tales and Traditions of the Emerald Isle</a> Signature Land trip, we will explore the historic castle with the help of a knowledgeable National Geographic Expert. Not only that, a visit to the National Craft Gallery, which is Ireland&#8217;s leading center for contemporary craft and design, located on the site of Kilkenny Castle’s former stables will be another fascinating stop on the tour.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Experience the Dublin Lifestyle </strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Ireland’s capital is full of exciting culture and history with so much to experience, but don’t worry, there will be ample time dedicated to exploring this port city. </p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Dine like a Local </em></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>What better way to dive into Irish culture than to dine like a local? On both the <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/europe/ireland-vacations/daily-itinerary/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0316230003A">Adventures by Disney’s Ireland</a> and the <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/europe/british-isles-vacations/daily-itinerary/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0316230005A">British Isles</a> trips, guests will enjoy delicious Irish food and lively music during a private lunch in a <strong>traditional Irish pub</strong>. Afterward, there will be a chance to explore all the excitement that the city has to offer. </p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Watch Irish History Come to Life </em></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>A private tour of the world’s first fully digital museum, the <strong>“Epic – The Irish Emigration Museum”</strong> is one of our first stops in Dublin on the <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/europe/ireland-vacations/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0316230004A">Adventures by Disney’s Ireland</a> and <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/europe/british-isles-vacations/daily-itinerary/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0316230005A">British Isles</a> itinerary.

Ireland’s gorgeous coastline with stops in exciting spots along the way. </p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><em>See the “Upside-Down Lighthouse” — and Puffins!</em></h6>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Expedition cruising offers an entirely different perspective and viewpoint of the Emerald Isle. The <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/ocean/expedition-cruise-dublin-ireland-scotland/">Voyage to Scotland’s Wild Isles Expedition Cruise with National Geographic Expeditions</a> mainly focuses on exploring Scotland but makes an exciting stop on a rugged island off Ireland’s northern coast called <strong>Rathlin Island</strong>. It’s home to only 200 humans, but it’s one of Ireland’s largest puffin communities! An Expert will guide our exploration of the island’s historic significance by highlighting important stories and bringing us to the century-old Rathlin West Light (aka the “upside-down lighthouse”). </p>
</div>


<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Unravel the Titanic’s History</em></h6>

<p>History and maritime enthusiasts will be

during the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/destinations/europe/ocean/england-ireland-scotland-and-wales-a-circumnavigation/">Ancient Isles Expedition Cruise with National Geographic
Expeditions</a>. During a visit to the Cobh Heritage Center,
we will experience exhibits about the town’s maritime history, Irish
emigration, the potato famine, and even The Titanic. Cobh was the vessel’s
final port of call, and, as a notable site in this piece of global history,
shares unique insight and artifacts from the ship. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Guests on the <a href="https://www.adventuresbydisney.com/europe/british-isles-vacations/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q2wo0316230006A">British Isles itinerary with Adventures by Disney</a> also experience a piece of Titanic history while exploring Belfast, the city where the ship was built.
