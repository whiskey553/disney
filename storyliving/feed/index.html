<p>The paint is dry, landscaping is planted, the art is displayed and the finishing touches are all complete on the first model homes at the Cotino community. From stylish interiors to spacious outdoor living areas, these brand-new model homes give a glimpse of what living at Cotino will look like for future residents.</p>

<p>The community’s first three model homes were built by award-winning homebuilder <a href="https://www.storylivingbydisney.com/cotino/our-builders/shea-homes/?CMP=ILC-DPFY25Q1wo1107240014F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shea Homes</a> and showcase different floorplan options. With interior design by a renowned firm, each of the homes draws inspiration from Disney stories across animation and theme parks. </p>

<p>The Melodia model home embodies contemporary design with a sleek, minimalist aesthetic. The interior design for the model home drew inspiration from&nbsp;Walt Disney Animation Studios’ classic “One Hundred and One Dalmatians” and takes a modern spin on Cruella’s favorite color palette by blending neutral tones with striking black accents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walking into this swinging home will have you feeling groovy!

<p>Did you know Walt Disney Imagineering provided creative insight on the community’s unique home designs? Disney Imagineers were inspired by the rich history and landscape of the area from the&nbsp;beauty and agricultural origins of the Coachella Valley to the region’s famed mid-century modern architecture and more contemporary styles. They shared their creative inspiration with Cotino community developer DMB Development and architectural design firms who contributed to the home designs that are currently being brought to life by talented homebuilders.</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The first community park under construction is Longtable Park. The park’s unique name is inspired by Walt Disney and the experiences that originally drew him to the Coachella Valley. When Walt visited the area, he would often begin his day with some desert adventures then join his neighbors for a group breakfast and good conversation around a friendly table.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Cotino community residents can keep that same friendly spirit alive while spending time at Longtable Park.

<p>The two-story house will be a multi-functional space where club members can attend events, celebrate milestones and even enjoy an occasional overnight stay. The community’s Artisan Club will be a go-to gathering place for members and their guests with engaging spaces dedicated to delicious dining, exploring creative pursuits, working out, water recreation on <a href="https://www.storylivingbydisney.com/cotino/artisan-club/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q4wo0912240053H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cotino Bay</a>, and unique programs and experiences that only Disney can provide. &nbsp;</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Coming to life in the beautiful Palm Springs area, renowned for its mid-century modern architecture, Parr House will represent a full 360 moment – Pixar artists visited the region while dreaming up the original design for the Parr family’s home in “Incredibles 2” and now, a home inspired by the film is being built in the same place!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mid-Century Modern Design: Honoring a Local Legacy</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>When it came time to start designing the Parr House, Disney Imagineers and Pixar artists collaborated to bring the spirit of the film to life with a creative interpretation of the mid-century modern design the Palm Springs area is known for.</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="767" height="431" src="https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior-767x431.png" alt="Concept art of Parr House exterior" class="wp-image-353197" srcset="https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior-767x431.png 767w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior-426x239.png 426w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior-250x140.png 250w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior-768x432.png 768w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior-1536x864.png 1536w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior-1024x576.png 1024w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Exterior.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Parr House view from Cotino Bay </figcaption></figure></div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>To bring the home’s inspiration out of the animated “Incredibles” universe and into the real world, Imagineers will use a rich mix of textures and colors. The home’s interior will incorporate the hallmarks of mid-century modern design, clean lines, natural light and functional furniture, while adding artistic flair in the finishes, artwork and décor.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>From a primary bedroom fit for Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl to the family kitchen and open living room, it will be an extraordinary home we know Edna Mode would just love, dah-ling!</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Memorable Moments: Recalling Favorite Film Details</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Looking at the renderings, you may even recognize a few familiar details sprinkled throughout the space…</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Since the Parr House is inspired by our favorite super family, Imagineers are planning to add in a few special film props like boxes of Sugar Bombs and Fiber O’s cereal stacked on the kitchen shelf and the family’s schedule scribbled on the Insuricare calendar. Can you spot them in the rendering below?</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="767" height="431" src="https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen-767x431.png" alt="Concept art of Parr House kitchen" class="wp-image-353198" srcset="https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen-767x431.png 767w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen-426x239.png 426w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen-250x140.png 250w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen-768x432.png 768w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen-1536x864.png 1536w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen-1024x576.png 1024w, https://disneyparksblog.com/app/uploads/2024/09/2024-storyliving-Parr-House-Kitchen.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Parr House kitchen</figcaption></figure></div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>It’s all about the details as Imagineers have poured over original concept art from the film to find special details and unique decorative items to bring this home to life.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Even the design color palette is reflective of the film’s iconic characters and settings. In communal areas like the living room and kitchen, tones of red, black and yellow will pay homage to the family’s iconic super suits while upstairs, each of the bedrooms will reflect the style of “Incredibles” characters including Edna Mode, Lucius Best aka “Frozone” and the Parr kids Jack-Jack, Violet and Dash.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The first-floor art studio will celebrate the Cotino community’s overall theme as a creative oasis – a place to relax, retreat and explore new ambitions. The idea was inspired by <a href="https://disneyparksblog.com/storyliving/never-before-seen-designs-revealed-for-first-storyliving-by-disney-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walt Disney himself, who retreated to his family home in the Palm Springs area to rest and creatively recharge</a>.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From Screen to Street: How the Parr House is Being Built</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>How did this superhero home go from animation to active construction project? Imagineers enlisted the help of Cotino community homebuilder <a href="https://www.storylivingbydisney.com/cotino/our-builders/davidson-communities/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q4wo0912240054H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Davidson Communities</a> to help build the Parr House.</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Together, the design teams plan to adapt some of the home’s iconic features, like the floor-to-ceiling windows and climbing rock work in the living room, to the real world.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The home’s expansive windows will provide unmatched views of <a href="https://www.storylivingbydisney.com/cotino/#the-disney-difference?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q4wo0912240002H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cotino Bay</a>, the jewel of the community that will feature the clearest turquoise waters with Crystal Lagoons technology.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Because the home’s exterior will be so recognizable, Imagineers wanted the interior view of the outside to be equally impressive. Beyond the beautiful windows, an elevated patio will offer a picturesque place for outdoor events with spectacular water and mountain views.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Currently under construction, this <em>incredible </em>Artisan Club amenity is expected to open in 2025.</p>

<p>Today is an exciting day for Storyliving by Disney! We’re sharing a first look at plans for <a href="http://www.storylivingbydisney.com/asteria?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1130230017A">Asteria</a>, a new <a href="http://www.storylivingbydisney.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1130230016A">Storyliving by Disney</a> residential community coming to life in the heart of North Carolina near Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Inspired by the spirit of discovery, the Asteria community is being designed to encourage exploration, spark life-long learning and create new connections for future residents.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/slbdctnc4759739719971.jpg" alt="Rendering of the new Asteria, a Storyliving by Disney Community, coming to North Carolina" class="wp-image-331254" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Storyliving by Disney team has been working closely with Disney Imagineers and DMB Development to develop a unique vision for this community inspired by Walt Disney’s innate curiosity and passion for learning.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Walt once said, “We keep moving forward, opening new doors and doing new things because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Influenced by Walt’s perspective and the nearby universities in North Carolina’s renowned Research Triangle, the Asteria community is envisioned as a campus of discovery – where future residents can learn and grow, bringing a touch of Disney magic into their everyday lives in a way that only Storyliving by Disney communities can.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>There are so many exciting new discoveries ahead for the all-new Asteria community! Here are three things we can’t wait to explore:</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Adventure is Out There: Discovering the Beauty of North Carolina</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Asteria community will bring Storyliving by Disney to an entirely new setting on the East Coast – North Carolina! The community will come to life on approximately 1,500 acres in picturesque Chatham County, just outside the state’s vibrant capital of Raleigh.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/slbdctnc4759739719973.jpg" alt="People wlaking and jogging through the woods on a paved path, a lday walking a dog" class="wp-image-331255" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>North Carolina’s rich landscape and history are at the heart of Walt Disney Imagineering’s initial planning work alongside DMB Development. Disney Imagineers are pulling inspiration from the area to imagine spaces where nature is always on display, blurring the lines of indoor and outdoor living. To encourage exploration, the community will feature acres of neighborhood parks and miles of beautiful walking and biking trails where residents can connect with the fauna and flora of the outdoors.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In fact, the name Asteria pays homage to the native North Carolina aster flower. The flower is also the namesake of the goddess Asteria. In Greek mythology, Asteria’s tears of stardust fell to the Earth and sprouted the first aster flowers. Disney Imagineers chose the community’s name to honor North Carolina’s natural beauty from the Earth to the sky.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Life-Long Learning: Resident Amenities Designed to Spark Curiosity</strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Asteria community homeowners will become part of a club with amenities and programming designed to encourage learning and connectivity – both with their fellow neighbors and the outdoors.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The club is planned to include a variety of spaces for residents to gather and pursue new interests including a wellness and recreation center, restaurant, sport courts, swimming pools, community garden and plenty of outdoor space for lawn games, events and fire pits.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Beyond beautiful gathering spaces, the club will feature enrichment programming only Disney can deliver. Some of the experiences the team is dreaming up include family fun days with Disney-themed games and activities, storytelling dinners inspired by classic Disney tales and classes with Disney artists.</p>
</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting a New Story: The Asteria Community Lifestyle </strong><strong></strong></h5>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Asteria community will offer future residents distinctive Disney placemaking and outstanding customer service thanks in part to contributions from the creativity of Disney Imagineers. A range of home styles will line quaint streets leading to a mix of community amenities specifically designed to showcase the area’s surrounding natural beauty. There are plans for more than 4,000 residential units, including single-family and multi-family homes, with some home sites specifically designated for 55+ adults.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Ideally situated near Raleigh, Chapel Hill and Durham in the town of Pittsboro, future Asteria community residents will have access to big-city amenities with the charm of a small town. The Asteria community will be part of the larger, award-winning <a href="https://chathampark.com/">Chatham Park</a> master-planned community.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/23487tyo82guk3fe67ityguk23t435h4t.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-331258" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Asteria community is in the beginning stages of planning with Walt Disney Imagineering and DMB Development. Homes in the community will be built by select homebuilders with sales anticipated to begin by 2027. Additional details including an option to join the community’s email list can be found by visiting <a href="http://www.storylivingbydisney.com/asteria?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1130230017A">storylivingbydisney.com/asteria</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Asteria community is the second announced Storyliving by Disney community in the U.S. following the <a href="http://www.storylivingbydisney.com/cotino?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1130230018A">Cotino</a> community, which is currently under development in Rancho Mirage, California. Additional Storyliving by Disney locations are under exploration.</p>

<p>The Cotino community is imagined as a place that reflects everything that Walt and Lillian Disney loved about the Coachella Valley – stunning landscape, rich history, friendly community and energizing spirit.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>“It seems fitting that Cotino, the first Storyliving by Disney community, would have a similar setting as the one that Walt loved so much,” said Walt Disney Archives Director Becky Cline. “Walt enjoyed the Palm Springs area as a creative, rejuvenating retreat and our hope is that it will inspire future homeowners and guests just like it did him.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:15px"><strong>Only at Cotino: Home Designs</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The first homes will be built by award-winning builder Shea Homes with floorplans available only in the Cotino community. From spacious kitchens with walk-in pantries to large dining rooms perfect for family gatherings, the homes in Cotino community will offer future residents the flexibility to choose an option that works best for them. Open floorplans seamlessly connect indoor space to outdoor courtyards, wrap-around patios and covered terraces designed to truly immerse residents in the beauty of the region.</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Homes will fall within <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2022/06/first-look-home-inspiration-concepts-for-cotino-a-storyliving-by-disney-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four distinct design collections</a> – Cotino Coachella Collection, Cotino Agrarian Collection, Cotino Oasis Collection and Cotino Aspiron Collection – representing the rich history and landscape of the Palm Springs area. From options reflecting the beauty and agricultural origins of the Coachella Valley and nods to the region’s mid-century modern legacy to more contemporary styles, Walt Disney Imagineering brought a touch of magic to the Cotino community by providing the architectural and aesthetic inspiration for each design collection.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:15px"><strong>Looking Ahead: ‘Incredible’ Amenities In the Works</strong></h2>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Beyond beautiful homes, the Cotino community will offer a voluntary Artisan Club with amenities and experiences infused with Disney touches and renowned service. Club members will be able to dine, gather and play together in the club’s restaurant, pool, pickleball and tennis courts, and waterfront bar and activity area.&nbsp;Located along Cotino Bay, which will feature the clearest turquoise waters with Crystal Lagoons® technology, club members will be able to make a splash in dedicated swim areas along with access to kayaks and paddle boards. The club will also be home to the <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2023/03/incredible-amenities-coming-to-the-first-storyliving-by-disney-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-of-a-kind Parr House</a>. Designed to look like the Parr family home in Disney and Pixar’s “Incredibles 2,” the multi-functional space will be available for members to attend club-hosted events.</p>
</div>

</div></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Disney difference will come to life through the club’s daily enrichment programs focused on life-long learning, discovery and fun. For example, the creative team is coming up with fun-filled experiences that are planned to be available from time to time like storytelling dinners featuring meals inspired by classic Disney tales, art lessons with Disney artists or family days with Disney-themed activities and games.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>For those interested in living in the Cotino community, pre-sales appointments are now available for the initial release which includes a very limited inventory from Shea Homes. Additional home sites and builders will be introduced in phases as the community expands. More information, including additional details about the first available homes and next steps for scheduling a pre-sales appointment, can be found on the <a href="https://www.cotinocommunity.com/story/?CMP=ILC-DPFY24Q1wo1109230023A">Story of Cotino website</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Cotino community is the first Storyliving by Disney community in the U.S. and other locations are under exploration. Each community will be uniquely designed with creative guidance from Walt Disney Imagineers who will take inspiration from the surrounding area’s history, community and landscape to create a one-of-a-kind place that inspires residents to write their next chapter.</p>

<p>A new story is being written in Rancho Mirage, California at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.storylivingbydisney.com/cotino/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q4wo0907230013H"><em>Cotino</em></a>, the very first&nbsp;<em>Storyliving by Disney</em>&nbsp;community!&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We’re excited to share a first glimpse of what future residents can expect at the <em>Cotino</em> community.&nbsp;<a href="https://storylivingbydisney.com/content/dam/slbd/cotino/Phase%201%20Announcement%20map%202023-07-31.pdf?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q4wo0907230014H">Initial plans</a>&nbsp;for the first “chapter” of the community’s story includes more than 300 homes and a collection of community parks set in the heart of California’s scenic Coachella Valley.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Imagine meeting your neighbor for a morning walk along the promenade with views of Cotino Bay, which will feature the clearest turquoise waters with <em>Crystal Lagoons®</em> technology, or enjoying a family picnic as the sun sets over the surrounding mountains. The <em>Cotino</em> community’s design will promote connectivity with picturesque walking paths and landscaped parks where neighbors and their families can socialize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The community will feature a range of home types allowing homebuyers to select the best home for their needs. Using creative framework developed by Walt Disney Imagineering, home designs will be inspired by the rich history, landscape and beauty of the greater Palm Springs area and brought to life by select homebuilders.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Within the first phase of development, there will be an area dedicated to adults 55+ known as the Longtable Park residences. The name Longtable Park is inspired by the experiences that originally drew Walt to the Coachella Valley. When he visited the area, he often enjoyed desert activities in the morning and joined his neighbors for a group breakfast and good conversation around a friendly table.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Longtable Park residents will have exclusive access to a dedicated gathering place, Longtable Park. This&nbsp;space will bring people together around a large, centerpiece table&nbsp;surrounded by beautiful palo verde and olive trees along with shaded seating and barbecue grills – the perfect place to spend time with friends and family.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Residents of all ages and their favorite four-legged friends can spend the day playing at Laughing Place Ranch. Designed to celebrate Walt’s love for horses, this equestrian-themed dog park will feature separate play areas where small and large pets can jump and gallop the day away!&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>There is so much more to the <em>Cotino</em> community story and we can’t wait to share more with you soon!</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Pre-sales appointments to discuss additional residential details including floorplans, home designs and pricing are anticipated to begin later this year prior to the launch of home sales.</p>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>As the very first <em>Storyliving
by Disney </em>community continues to blossom in Rancho Mirage, California, I am
excited to share some of the unique elements that will bring Disney adventures
to life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Hmmm … Does that house look familiar to you?</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>The Cotino community will offer the opportunity for individuals to purchase a membership for
the Artisan Club that will unlock a dazzling array of
amenities infused with unique Disney and Pixar touches. Highlights include a
one-of-a-kind gathering space inspired by an “incredible” location from a
fan-favorite Pixar film, part of a vibrant club featuring a diverse range of
leisure pursuits.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Nestled along the shoreline of the grand oasis is Parr
House, a distinct location inspired by the midcentury home of the famous family
of superheroes in Disney and Pixar’s “Incredibles 2.” </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Parr House is
being brought to life by Walt Disney Imagineering as a “super” fun place for
special events, celebrations and limited overnight accommodations for Artisan
Club members, all subject to availability. This space will immerse club members
and their guests in an environment featuring iconic decor, curated art and rich
colors from the film. Along Parr House’s exterior, an elevated patio will
present spectacular views of the grand oasis and the surrounding mountains. Talk
about “super,” am I right?</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wefyuobhyguf793ru2487y1311.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-313334" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In addition to Parr House, Artisan Club members will
experience a touch of the Disney lifestyle in a clubhouse complex featuring
distinct spaces for dining, wellness, art, recreation and entertainment. All
amenities are being thoughtfully inspired by Disney Imagineers to foster
community connections and encourage the pursuit of individual passions. </p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wefyuobhyguf793ru2487y1313.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-313335" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Voluntary club membership will offer access to the
waterfront&nbsp;clubhouse, club-only beach area and recreational water
activities, as well as Disney entertainment and magical events. Separate from
the private clubhouse, there will be a beach park, accessible to the public with
the purchase of a day pass. </p>
</div>

<p>The story of the Cotino community is just
beginning, and we look forward to sharing more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the picturesque desert of Rancho Mirage, California, the very first <em>Storyliving by Disney</em> community is beginning to come to life! </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Our team of Disney Imagineers is collaborating with industry expert developers, architects, and builders to create <em>Cotino</em> community, a place where people can write the next chapter of their lives — and in a place near and dear to our founder, Walt Disney.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Whenever Walt needed to get away from the hustle
and bustle of work, he would retreat to the Greater Palm Springs Area to
reignite his imagination. Lovingly referred to as his “laughing place,” Walt
would take time to unwind and ask himself the age-old question, “what comes
next?”</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>We’re so excited to give you a peek behind the curtain of <em>Cotino</em> community in our special four-part video series, “The Story Behind the Making of <em>Cotino</em>, a <em>Storyliving by Disney</em> community.” In the series, you will hear from some of the Disney Imagineers working on <em>Cotino</em> community and learn what is inspiring them. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>In our first installment, meet our Creative Director, Amy<strong> </strong>Young, who shares with us how the concept of a “creative oasis” is becoming a reality in <em>Cotino</em> community. Future installments will include “Setting the Stage,” “Magic is in the Details” and “The Big Idea,” each featuring a different Disney Imagineer. </p>
</div>





<div class="block-paragraph">
<p><br>Be sure to stay tuned to the <em>Storyliving by Disney</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/storylivingbydisney/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/storylivingbydisney/">Instagram</a> pages over the next few weeks as we share more from our extraordinary Imagineers working on <em>Cotino</em> community. </p>

<p>Imagine the thrilling day when sweeping, stylish homes in <em>Cotino, </em>a<em> <a href="https://www.storylivingbydisney.com/?CMP=ILC-DPFY22Q3wo0616220009A">Storyliving by Disney</a></em> community, begin rising from the valley floor! Today, I&#8217;m excited to share a first look at the design concepts that will inspire the homes in this dream community.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>With the rich history, culture and boundless beauty of California&#8217;s Coachella Valley for inspiration, DMB Development worked alongside the architectural design firm, WHA, with creative insight from Walt Disney Imagineering, to develop several inspirational home concepts that builders -can use to craft the homes in the community. </p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>Before home building begins, officials in the City of Rancho Mirage will review the <em>Cotino </em>community’s Preliminary Development Plan including these home design inspirations and a collection of home floor plans. The plans submitted are not intended be actual homes; they are meant to be representative inspiration of the types of homes and designs that builders will offer in the <em>Cotino</em> community. </p>

<p>I have some big news to share! As more fans look for new ways to make Disney a bigger part of their lives, today we are announcing plans to introduce <strong><em>Storyliving by Disney,</em></strong> vibrant new neighborhoods that are infused with our special brand of magic<strong><em>. </em></strong>Each community will feature distinctively designed spaces, unique amenities and Disney’s brand of world-renowned service.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>These
master-planned, new home communities are intended to
inspire residents to foster new friendships, pursue their interests and write
the next exciting chapter in their lives —all while enjoying the attention to
detail and special touches that are Disney hallmarks.</p>
</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/uilh24ty7ui2h3ti4lgyiuh3r4.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-284006" /></figure>


<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>At each location, including some neighborhoods for residents ages 55+, Disney cast members trained in the company’s legendary guest service will operate the community association. Through a club membership, Disney will also provide access to curated experiences, such as wellness programming; entertainment ranging from live performances to cooking classes; philanthropic endeavors; seminars and much more.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-paragraph">
<p>And where will the first one be? None other than a place that has known the footsteps of Walt Disney himself! <em>Cotino</em>, a <em>Storyliving by Disney</em> community, will be built in the heart of the Coachella Valley in Rancho Mirage, Calif. If you’re a Disney history fan, you might know that the brilliant mountain-ringed valley in the Greater Palm Spring area was once a rejuvenating retreat for Walt and Lillian Disney!</p>
</div>



<div class="block-paragraph">
<p><br>Check out this video to learn more about the proposed plans for <em>Cotino</em>, a <em>Storyliving by Disney</em> community. We will be working with highly respected real estate developers and experienced home builders at each site, who will contribute their talents and expertise to each community.</p>
